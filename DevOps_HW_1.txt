"OSI Model" --> "Open System Interconnection" --> 7 Layers

7.Physical Layer
		-->transmission & reception of unstructured raw data
		-->between a device & a physical transmission medium
	-->transmits : bit to signal/frequency
	-->purpose : transmission
	-->device : connectors, hub, modem, repeater
6.Data Link Layer
		-->provides nopde to node data transfer , a link between 2 directly connected nodes
		-->two sublayers: i)MAC
						  ii)LLC
	-->transmits : frame
	-->purpose : i)MAC-->provides flow control and multiplexing
				ii)LLC-->provides flow and error control and identifies live protocols
	-->device : switch, router, modem, ap
5.Network Layer
		-->transmits packets between 2 nodes connected in different networks
		-->A network is a medium to which many can be connected
	-->transmits : packet
	-->purpose : addressing, routing
	-->device : router (server)
4.Transport Layer
		-->provides functional & procedural means to tranfer variable length data sequence from destination to host.
		-->mainly manages the delivery & error checking of data packets
	-->transmits : Segment(TCP)/Datagram(UDP)
	-->purpose : reliability
	-->device : firewall
3.Session Layer
		-->controls the connection between computers, local and remote
		-->non-existent in modern TCP/IP system
	-->transmits : message
	-->purpose : authentication/authorization
	-->device : gateway
2.Presentation Layer
		-->establishes context between application layer entities
		-->provides mapping between them
		-->basically, formats/translates data for the application layer based on the syntax the application accepts.
	-->transmits : messaage
	-->purpose : formatting, encrypting, compressing
	-->device : it is a protocol
1.Application Layer
		-->in this layer both the end user and the application layer interact directly with the software application
	-->transmits : message
	-->purpose : Interface(API)
	-->device : no such devices, a web browser is one of the examples.
